_Request and obtain intraday trades for hundreds of stock market symbols for a number of days_

predIQtive uses a [Google Apps Script (GAS)]( https://developers.google.com/apps-script/ ) and spreadsheet in order to obtain its market data.

## Concept

Request and obtain stock market intraday data for hundreds of symbols sourced via Wikipedia, Google and Yahoo

### Issues / Problems



### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->


## Developer Notes

Issue:files hosted on GitHub Pages cannot be set to rub at fixed time

Solution: Run files using Google Apps Script which allows for triggers to run scipts at fixed times and intervals

Issue: Using GAS, cannot send 500 files to GitHub all at once.

Solution: Triggers can be set for every 30, 15, 10, 5 or 1 minutes

Current timings: sending 25 symbols once a minute. Takes over a thousand seconds, but has had very few failures. Speed-ups will be explored.

### Wish List / To Do

Soon
* 2017-05-01 ~ Don't erase previous tweet count run until just before new count
* 2017-04-30 ~ Confirm trigger for every day of week
* 2017-04-30 ~ Push next run to next day when time is after the designated hour
* 2017-04-30 ~ Add headers to spreadsheet
* 2017-04-29 ~ Add way of getting several previous days - repair after an error
* 2017-04-29 ~ Add verify function
* 2017-04-25 ~ Add getMoreTicks function
* 2017-04-25 ~ Catch errors on getTick - especially over six minutes termination error - and start new trigger
* 2017-04-24 ~ filesToGitHub: show how many files uploaded each run
* 2017-04-23 ~ try out add multiple files

More
* Select exchange & portfolio
* Get trades for selected symbols or portfolio of issues not in sp500
* Display start index << ??
