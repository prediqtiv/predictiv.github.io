[Device Parameters Test ]( https://prediqtiv.github.io/device-parameters-test/device-parameters-test-r1.html )


This is a test utility to hide the menu depending on the rotation of a phone.

If you are using a mobile device in portrait mode,
when you first load the test, the hamburger menu should be off-screen.
If you are not on a mobile device or you open a mobile in landscape mode, then the hamburger menu should be visible.

If you return to landscape mode, the menu stays in whatever state it was un portrait mode

Comments and suggstions welcome
