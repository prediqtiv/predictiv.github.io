_Development version - may have issues_

## Issues

* 2017-05-01 ~ eyeCue Replay Heads-Up display reports Twitter cashtag count incorrectly

## Concept

_“If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.”_ — Albert Einstein

### Issues / Problems

Trying to gauge the movements of hundreds of stocks while they are trading is not easy.
It is quite difficult to note which are the outliers and which are in the middle of the pack.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* Derive real-time company intelligence from public sources to help users make better-informed investing and business decisions.
* View hundreds of market symbols in a non-reductionist manner
* Be able to get a picture of how the market is flowing

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* Help traders find interesting trading circumstances
* Spin-offs might tackle: financial markets, currencies, weather, Internet traffic

## Two types of Scripts here

* Data gathering
* Data visualization 3D

## Data Gathering

Currently there are several apps hosted on different types of servers


### GitHub Hosting

* GitHub provides hosting for static files such as HTML files, style sheets, images and JavaScript files at no charge
* Once accessed, files load and run on the client computer
* Files are available with low latency and thus load quite fast
* There is no easy way to run files on a schedule

### Hosted on GitHub: [Trades Get]( https://jaanga.github.io/sp500/trades-get/ )

* Request and obtain intraday trades for hundreds of stock market symbols for a number of days
* Saves data to local drive - data must then be commited by a human to GitHub
* Must be loaded and run by a human every day
* The app appears to be quite stable and seems to run without issue whenever it's called
* See the SP500 Trades Get [Read Me]( https://prediqtiv.github.io/#trades-get/README.md ) ffor much more detail


### Hosted on Google Apps Script (GAS)

* Wikipedia [Google Apps Script]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Apps_Script ) - a scripting language for light-weight application development in the Google Apps platform
* Google: [Google Apps Script]( https://developers.google.com/apps-script/ ) - Create add-ons for Google Sheets, Docs, or Forms, automate your workflow, integrate with external APIs, and more.

Why Gas?
* It's available at no charge
* Code runs on a server
* Code forking and sharing is built-in
* Triggers can be set to run at designated events or times - down to ine minute intervals - with no human intervention


### Hosted on Google Apps Script: [SP500-trades-get]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qe8UxwBWIMmlFrsTMxkorJwlX4beGQAeRNANSjJ8TME )

* Runs on a GAS server
* Loads the Wikipedia page with the list of SP500 components
* Uses the GAS spreadsheet GoogleFinance functions to gather the market capitalization anf the average daily volume for each symbol
* Uses an undocumented Google service to gather one minute intraday day for each og the symbols
* Uses the GitHuB API - and invoking [OAuth]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth ) for authorization - to send files from the Google servers to the GitHub servers

### Hosted on Google Apps Script: [SP500 Twitter Cashtags Get]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ySMstriI4Fb93CXp8_dF1FKK9dJXvuzMmjyHzpRN5KY )

* Runs on a GAS server
* Uses the Twitter API - with OAuth - to gather the current 'cashtags' for each of the 500 symbols
* Uses the GitHuB API - and invoking [OAuth]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth ) for authorization - to send the Twitter data from the Google servers to the GitHub servers
* See [Read Me]( https://prediqtiv.github.io/#tweets/README.md ) for more detail

### Upcoming

* Both GAS scripts need work on improving  the reliability of completion as well as better recovery from error
* Get official Twitter name for each symbol - using the Twitter search API



## Data Visualization 3D

There are two scripts of note here

### eyeCue SP500 Realtime

* SP500 near realtime ~ updates about once a minute

### eyeCue SP500 Replay

* SP500 replay ~ select and follow entire days of one minute intraday trading


### Usage Notes

The first time you run the Jaanga SP500 scripts, you may need to refresh the page in order for everything to load properly.
The script only runs on devices that support [WebGL]( https://get.webgl.org/ ).

Once the script is running, updates will occur every minute or so - and you will see the symbols move just a bit,

**Navigation**
* Roll = left or 1 finger
* Zoom = scroll or 2 finger
* Move = right or 3 finger

**Desktop/laptop**
* Move your cursor over symbols to see their charts pop up. Click on empty area to clear.

**Tablet/phone**
* Not quite as easy as desktop. You may need to smudge or wiggle your finger in order to show the pop-up.
Click on an empty space to clear selection before clicking on another symbol

**Indicators**
During the trading day the symbols move across the table
* Left/Red - Right/Green. Symbols in the green area are gainers. Symbols in the red are losers.
The further the symbols are from the centerline the more they are gaining or losing.
Symbol stuck at the edges of the table have gained or lost over 20%
* Front/Start - Back/Finish. Movement from start to finish is based on volume - the current volume divided by the average daily volume.
All symbols start at zero. Symbols at the back have reached or exceeded 600% of the symbols average daily volume in that session

### Features
