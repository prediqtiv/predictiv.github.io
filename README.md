_Development version - may have issues_


## Concept

_It's all very beta - including this documentation_

### Issues / Problems

Trying to gauge the movements of hundreds of stocks while they are trading is not easy.
It is quite difficult to note which are the outliers and which are in the middle of the pack.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* View hundreds of market symbols in a non-reductionist manner
* Be able to get a picture of how the market is flowing

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* Help traders find interesting trading circumstances
* Spin-offs might tackle: financial markets, currencies, weather, Internet traffic

## Two types of Scripts here

* Data gathering
* Data visualization 3D

## Data Gathering

Currently there is is a single app

### [Trades Get]( https://jaanga.github.io/sp500/trades-get/ )

* Request and obtain intraday trades for hundreds of stock market symbols for a number of days
   * Save data to local drive

### Upcoming

* Get official Twitter name for each symbol - using Twitter API
* Save trades data directly to GitHub?
* Gather trades data via Google Scripts Chron job?


## Data Visualization 3D

There are two scripts of note here

* SP500 Realtime
	* SP500 near realtime ~ updates about once a minute
* SP500 Replay
	* SP500 replay ~ select and follow entire days of one minute intraday trading


### Usage Notes

The first time you run the Jaanga SP500 scripts, you may need to refresh the page in order for everything to load properly.
The script only runs on devices that support [WebGL]( https://get.webgl.org/ ).

Once the script is running, updates will occur every minute or so - and you will see the symbols move just a bit,

**Navigation**
* Roll = left or 1 finger
* Zoom = scroll or 2 finger
* Move = right or 3 finger

**Desktop/laptop**
* Move your cursor over symbols to see their charts pop up. Click on empty area to clear.

**Tablet/phone**
* Not quite as easy as desktop. You may need to smudge or wiggle your finger in order to show the pop-up.
Click on an empty space to clear selection before clicking on another symbol

**Indicators**
During the trading day the symbols move across the table
* Left/Red - Right/Green. Symbols in the green area are gainers. Symbols in the red are losers.
The further the symbols are from the centerline the more they are gaining or losing.
Symbol stuck at the edges of the table have gained or lost over 20%
* Front/Start - Back/Finish. Movement from start to finish is based on volume - the current volume divided by the average daily volume.
All symbols start at zero. Symbols at the back have reached or exceeded 600% of the symbols average daily volume in that session
